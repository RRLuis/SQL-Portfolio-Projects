Salary Data Exploration in SQL
Overview

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Salary Dataset using SQL. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about salaries, job titles, education levels, years of experience, and gender. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, uncover trends, and derive insights using SQL queries.
Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

    Age: Age of the employee.

    Gender: Gender of the employee (Male/Female).

    Education Level: Highest level of education attained by the employee.

    Job Title: Role or position of the employee.

    Years of Experience: Number of years of work experience.

    Salary: Annual salary of the employee.

SQL Queries

The SQL queries used for the analysis are stored in the salary_exploration.sql file. These queries include:

    Basic data exploration (e.g., selecting all records).

    Calculation of average salary by education level.

    Identification of maximum and minimum salaries by gender.

    Analysis of jobs with more than 5 employees.

    Calculation of the average salary difference between men and women.

    Exploration of average years of experience for specific job titles.

    Calculation of average salary excluding the highest and lowest salaries.

    Identification of employees earning above the average salary for their job title.

How to Use

    Download the Dataset: Download the dataset from Kaggle.

    Set Up the Database: Import the dataset into your preferred SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

    Run the Queries: Execute the SQL queries from the salary_exploration.sql file to reproduce the analysis.

    Explore Insights: Use the results of the queries to understand trends and patterns in the data.
