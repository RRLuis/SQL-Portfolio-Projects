# SQL Portfolio Projects

Welcome to the SQL Portfolio Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of SQL projects designed to showcase my skills in data exploration, analysis, and query optimization. Each project focuses on a different dataset, ranging from basic to advanced SQL topics. Below, you'll find an overview of the projects included.
Projects Included

## 1. Chinook Database Analysis

The Chinook Database represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, tracks, invoices, and customers.
Key Features:

    Basic Queries: Retrieve data from tables using SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN.

    Intermediate Queries: Use GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).

    Advanced Queries: Implement subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Example Queries:

    Top-selling artists and genres.

    Customer purchase history and lifetime value.

    Sales performance by country and employee.

## 2. Northwind Database Analysis

The Northwind Database contains data from a fictional company, including orders, products, customers, and suppliers.
Key Features:

    Data Exploration: Analyze sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

    Advanced SQL: Use window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK), recursive CTEs, and pivoting.

    Business Insights: Calculate key metrics like revenue, profit margins, and order fulfillment times.

Example Queries:

    Monthly sales growth and year-over-year comparisons.

    Customer segmentation based on order frequency and spending.

    Supplier performance and inventory management.

## 3. Other Projects

This repository also includes additional SQL projects, each focusing on a unique dataset and set of challenges.
